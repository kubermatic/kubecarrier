        description: "Ferry manages the deployment of the Ferry controller manager.
          \n Ferry lives in the Provider Namespace. For each ferry the KubeCarrier
          operator spins up the ferry controller deployment, necessary roles, service
          accounts, and role bindings. \n The reason for ferry controller deployment
          are multiples: * security --> KubeCarrier operator has greater privileges
          then ferry controller * resource isolation --> each ferry controller pod
          operates only on a single service cluster, \t\tthus resource allocation
          and monitoring is separate per ferry. This allows finer grade \t\tresource
          tuning and monitoring * flexibility --> If needed different ferries could
          have different deployments depending on \t\ttheir specific need (e.g. KubeCarrier
          image version for gradual rolling upgrade, different resource allocation,
          etc),"
