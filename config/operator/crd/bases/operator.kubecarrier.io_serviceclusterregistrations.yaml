      description: "ServiceClusterRegistration represents single kubernetes cluster
        belonging to the provider \n ServiceClusterRegistration lives in the provider
        namespace. For each tender the kubecarrier operator spins up the tender controller
        deployment, necessary roles, service accounts, and role bindings \n The reason
        for tender controller deployment are multiples: * security --> kubecarrier
        operator has greater privileges then tender controller * resource isolation
        --> each tender controller pod operates only on a single service cluster,
        \t\tthus resource allocation and monitoring is separate per tenders. This
        allows finer grade \t\tresource tuning and monitoring * flexibility --> If
        needed different tenders could have different deployments depending on \t\ttheir
        specific need (e.g. kubecarrier image version for gradual rolling upgrade,
        different resource allocation, etc),"
