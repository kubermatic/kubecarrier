## Installation

We strongly recommend that you use an [official release][3] of XXX. The tarballs for each release contain the
command-line client **and** version-specific sample YAML files for deploying XXX to your cluster.
Follow the instructions under the **Install** section of [our documentation][21] to get started.

_The code and sample YAML files in the master branch of the XXX repository are under active development and are not guaranteed to be stable. Use them at your own risk!_

## More information

[The documentation][21] provides a getting started guide, plus information about building from source, architecture, extending XXX, and more.

Please use the version selector at the top of the site to ensure you are using the appropriate documentation for your version of XXX.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues [file an issue][1] or talk to us on the [#XXX channel][12] on the [Kubermatic Slack][15].
